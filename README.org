#+TITLE: CWMP Protocol overview page

* Overview
  This package contains protocol object and application for CWMP protocol layer

* Installation

* Configuration
** app.config
  
   Riak and the Erlang applications it depends on are configured by
   settings in the =app.config= file in the =etc= directory of the
   embedded Erlang node.  The format of the file is similar to
   Erlang's ".app" files:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
   [
    {riak_kv, [
            {storage_backend, riak_kv_dets_backend},
            {riak_kv_dets_backend_root, "data/dets"}

            %% More Riak KV settings...
           ]}
    %% Other application configurations...
   ].
#+END_SRC

   That is, the file starts with =[=, and ends with =].=.  Inside the
   square brackets are comma-separated application sections of the
   form ={ApplictionName, [Setting1, Setting2, ...]}=.  Each setting
   is a 2-tuple of the form ={SettingName, SettingValue}=.
